# Principles

Reduce bugs and increase implementation speed of new features.

## SOLID

Applies to object-orientated programming.

* Single Responsibility Principle
  * Domain-dependent
  * Think about who - the role - that will be causing what changes and isolate that code together
  * Higher cohesion \(object has greater focus\)
  * Lower coupling \(object does not connect to or require knowledge of other object\)
* Open-Closed Principle
  * An object should be open for extension, but closed for modification
* Liskov Substitution Principle
  * A type may be replaced by its sub-types without causing any harm to the program,
  * Otherwise [your method must alter its behaviour](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/170222/what-can-go-wrong-if-the-liskov-substitution-principle-is-violated) by investigating the type of object its been given.
* Interface Segregation Principle
  * ???
* Dependency Inversion Principle
  * ???
