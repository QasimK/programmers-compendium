# Testing

Tests can be divided technically:

* unit-tests - tiny, no IO, no other components involved
* integration tests - test combined units 

They can be divided by purpose:

* functional tests - functional programming, test output based on input
* acceptance tests - the final end result tested at the highest, outer-most level \(e.g. using your web app with a web browser\)

They can be divided by who is doing them:

* end-to-end tests - performed by QA involving multiple distinct steps to accomplish a goal
* user acceptance tests - performed by non-technical business users or otherwise domain-experts to test whether the user accepts the software in their heart

But really, it's all fuzzy so don't worry about it.
