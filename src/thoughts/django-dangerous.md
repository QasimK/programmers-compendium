# Django considered Dangerous

I must preface this by saying I learnt Python through Django and I grew up with it for a decade of my life. I knew how to program in various other languages prior to this, but Django was a good reason I loved Python.

Now, I think it is good in specific circumstances that do not apply to most large software projects.

## The Ugly


## Alternatives

What doesn't work well (and what tended to happen with jQuery apps) is having state both on the client and on the server and having to coordinate between the two. So, consider an alternative way of building interactive interfaces:

## Others

Other people have had thoughts around Django as well. I have not read this:
